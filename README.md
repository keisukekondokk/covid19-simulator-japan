# COVID-19 Simulator in Japan

## Shiny Web Application
I developed a spatial Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model that analyzes the effect of interregional mobility on the spatial spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan (Kondo, 2020). The numerical simulations conducted in this study are provided on the web site "COVID-19 Simulator in Japan."

## Replication Files
The R code and data used in Kondo (2020) are available on GitHub.
